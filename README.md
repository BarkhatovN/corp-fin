There are notes that I made from "Corporate Finance / Jonathan B Berk; Peter M DeMarzo"

## Profitability ratios

`Profitability ratios are a class of financial metrics that are used to assess a business's ability to generate earnings compared to its expenses and other relevant costs incurred during a specific period of time. For most of these ratios, having a higher value relative to a competitor's ratio or relative to the same ratio from a previous period indicates that the company is doing well.`

### Gross Margin
`The gross margin represents the percent of total sales revenue that the company retains after incurring the direct costs associated with producing the goods and services it sells. The higher the percentage, the more the company retains on each dollar of sales, to service its other costs and debt obligations.`

**(Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Sales**


### Operating Margin

**Operating Income / Sales**


### EBIT Margins

**EBIT / Sales**


### Net Profit Margin

**Net Income / Sales**
