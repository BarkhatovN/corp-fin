There are notes that I made from "Corporate Finance / Jonathan B Berk; Peter M DeMarzo"

## Profitability ratios

`Profitability ratios are a class of financial metrics that are used to assess a business's ability to generate earnings compared to its expenses and other relevant costs incurred during a specific period of time. For most of these ratios, having a higher value relative to a competitor's ratio or relative to the same ratio from a previous period indicates that the company is doing well.`

### Gross Margin
`The gross margin represents the percent of total sales revenue that the company retains after incurring the direct costs associated with producing the goods and services it sells. The higher the percentage, the more the company retains on each dollar of sales, to service its other costs and debt obligations.`

**Gross Margin = (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Sales**


### Operating Margin

`Operating margin is a margin ratio used to measure a company's pricing strategy and operating efficiency.`
`Operating margin is a measurement of what proportion of a company's revenue is left over after paying for variable costs of production such as wages, raw materials, etc. It can be calculated by dividing a company’s operating income (also known as "operating profit") during a given period by its net sales during the same period. “Operating income” here refers to the profit that a company retains after removing operating expenses (such as cost of goods sold and wages) and depreciation. “Net sales” here refers to the total value of sales minus the value of returned goods, allowances for damaged and missing goods, and discount sales.`

**Operating Margin = (Operating Income) / Sales**


### EBITDA Margins

`EBITDA margin is a measurement of a company's operating profitability as a percentage of its total revenue. It is equal to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) divided by total revenue. Because EBITDA excludes interest, depreciation, amortization and taxes, EBITDA margin can provide an investor, business owner or financial professional with a clear view of a company's operating profitability and cash flow.`

**EBITDA Margins = EBIT / Sales**


### Net Profit Margin

**Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Sales**
