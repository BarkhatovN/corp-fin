## Profitability ratios

>Profitability ratios are a class of financial metrics that are used to assess a business's ability to generate earnings compared to its expenses and other relevant costs incurred during a specific period of time. For most of these ratios, having a higher value relative to a competitor's ratio or relative to the same ratio from a previous period indicates that the company is doing well.

Profitability Rations
Gross Margin = Gross Profit / Sales


Operating Margin = Operating Income / Sales


EBIT Margins = EBIT / Sales


Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Sales


Account Receivable Days = Accounts Receivable / Average Daily Sales
